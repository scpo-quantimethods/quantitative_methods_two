## Course organisation
- In total, each group will receive six tutorials. 
- Every two weeks, and organised in such a way that they follow the program of the theoretical classes. 
- Goal : briefly remind you the important content that you have seen in the theoretical class, 
- present you practical examples 
- how that can be done using RStudio, and finally to guide you through coding exercices.
